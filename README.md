# Plan, build and connect home network

_[?] In this project I will grant information about how I independently planed, built and connected home network_

_The guide covers single family house with router in living room, two rooms with network and hub in the attic that connects everything_

## Plan of the network at home.

1. Full plan that i drew when I needed to see what will be necessary:

![networkplan](https://github.com/szym10on/owning-a-server/assets/123908381/0a0141c5-0f76-4a5e-ae88-f2bedd172f6b)<br>

2. List of things that I ordered(or bought in local shop):<br>

➤ 35 meteres of ethernet cable. Bought more then needed just in case (~$0.3/m, 35 * 0.3 = $10.5)<br>
➤ 1x router (sponsored from our internet provider, ussually cost of ~$25-$200)<br>
➤ 1x 8 slot hub for connecting all the cables together ($~25)<br>
➤ 3x network sockets installed in a wall (~$5, 3 * 5 = $15)<br>
➤ 9x network plugs. Bought pack of 20 just in case (~$0.3/each, 20 * 0.3 = $6)<br>
➤ 1x network tool kit with tester, stripping tool and crimping tool (~$15)<br>
Costs may depend on country you live in.
All together: $71.5 without router cost.
